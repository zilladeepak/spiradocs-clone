Too often though, QA is implemented as Quality Control - whereby testing that the required functionality works as expected, is performed at the end, when it is most costly to make corrections and changes.</p> <p>To manage QA across a product from day one, it is imperative that the original requirements are documented together with the use-cases that validate the desired functionality. These use-cases then form the basis of the test scripts that can be executed to validate that the functionality has been correctly built, and that the requirements have been satisfied. During the execution of these test scripts, failures may occur, which are recorded as incidents - either to be fixed or documented depending on the severity.</p> <p>Typically, these activities require people to use at least three different types of software:</p> <ul> <li>Requirements Management</li> <li>Test Script Management</li> <li>Defect / Issue / Bug Tracking</li> </ul> <p>However, this stove-piped approach has many limitations and drawbacks, most importantly the fact that there is no traceability between the different artifacts. How can the product manager know that all the requirements have been tested? Conversely, how can the developer know which test script was responsible for a recorded bug -- needed to accurately reproduce the issue?</p>"},{"location":"articles/About/Intro.html#product-management","title":"Product Management","text":"<p>As described in the Agile Manifesto, traditional waterfall software methodologies and lifecycles have failed to deliver products on-time and on-budget. In addition, many systems built this way will fail to provide the expected business value as there is no ability to quickly refine the requirements as the product progresses.</p> <p>Consequently, software development has been transformed with these new ideas and concepts, with new agile methodologies such as Scrum, and Kanban becoming common. However, the traditional tools of product management - requirements specifications, high level product plans, GANTT charts, white-board schedules and top-down task management - are too cumbersome and not well suited.</p>"},{"location":"articles/About/Legal.html","title":"Legal Notices","text":"<p>This publication is provided as is without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p> <p>This publication could include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors.
